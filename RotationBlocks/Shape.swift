/*
    the idea here is that a 'shape' will be the objects on the game board

    each shape will be a collection of Block indexes based on the original starting shape

    an original shape will start like so

    [0][1]

    and then as other blocks become attached to it it will get larger like so

    [-1,0][0,0][1,0][2,0]
          [0,1][1,1]
